Here are the notes for the report:

Notes:

Online tuition duration was generally more than 1 hour 30 minutes, but due to data errors, it was manually entered as 1 hour 30 minutes only.

On regular days, tuition duration was a minimum of 1 hour 15 minutes, with one holiday per week.

In the last days, no holidays were taken, including Sundays, with an average of 3 to 4 hours per day.

Tuition sessions were conducted late at night and early in the morning as well.

The expected tuition duration for a regular month with 4 holidays is 32 hours 30 minutes (1 hour 15 minutes per day × 26 working days).

The total tuition duration for Table 2 (March 14 - April 1) was 70 hours 37 minutes.

For a regular month, the tuition fee is ₹12,000. Considering the extended hours in Table 2, the adjusted fee could be significantly higher based on the extra time spent.
